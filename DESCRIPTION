Description: For Imbalanced Domain Learning, resampling strategies are some of the most known strategies. This packages focuses on the problem of predicting extreme numerical values in dependency-oriented data such as time series. The package rewind presents a set of biased resampling strategies which are focused on applying such methods while taking into account the dependencies between consecutive data points in time.
